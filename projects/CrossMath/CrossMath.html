    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>CrossMath is a small Educational Game Project I created with a group of friends as a project for our enlish class. We had to come up with an educational game. My group and I decided to create a game, for children, that would make it more fun to practice basic Math. So we decided to combine Cross Words with simple Equations, that need to be solved. I prototyped the game in Unity Ã­n roughly 3-4 weeks during Uni.</p>
