    <p>CrossMath is a small educational game project I created with a group of friends as a project for our English class. We had to come up with an educational game. My group and I decided to create a casual puzzle game that would make it more fun to practice basic math. So, we decided to combine crosswords with simple equations, that need to be solved.</p>
    <p>The game starts off with a menu screen where the player can select an equation type (+,-,*,/) After that, the game randomly generates a crossword with different equations and some missing numbers. To solve the equations, one must type in the correct numbers. Upon completion a new crossword puzzle is generated with increasing difficulty (more equations and higher maximum numbers)</p>
