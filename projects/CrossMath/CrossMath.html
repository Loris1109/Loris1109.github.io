    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>CrossMath is a small Educational Game Project I created with a group of friends as a project for our english class. We had to come up with an educational game. My group and I decided to create a casual puzzel game that would make it more fun to practice basic Math. So we decided to combine Cross Words with simple Equations, that need to be solved.</p>
    <p>The Game starts of with a menu screen where the player can select an equation type (+,-,*,/) After that the game randomly generats a cross word with different equations and some missing numbers. To solve the equations one must type in the correct numbers. Upon completion a new cross word puzzel is generated with increasing difficulty (more eqations and higher maximum numbers)</p>
