    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As a final thesis to qualify for the german "Abitur" I created Flying Golf. A mobile puzzel golf game. The Goal is to get the ball into the hole but instead of clubs fans are used to blow the ball. The Player needs to solve multiple levels with increasing difficulty, by placing the fans on walls, celling and ground.</p>
