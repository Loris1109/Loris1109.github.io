    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As a final thesis to qualify for the German "Abitur" I created Flying Golf. A mobile puzzle golf game. The goal is to get the ball into the hole but instead of clubs fans are used to blow the ball. The player needs to solve multiple levels with increasing difficulty, by placing the fans on walls, ceiling and ground. To help aim correctly the trajectory of the ball is shown and updated in real time. I developed the working prototype in roughly 6 months. To finish the game the art assets are missing and the level design needs updating. In addition new typs of fans could easily be introduced. This was my first large project and one of my first games.</p>
